# Yo, I'm Aditya!

- I am in High School, Mission San Jose High '22.
- Building stuff and doing development in large projects is my jam.
- Was lucky enough to land a Life360 & Tala Security internship (read about it on my blog), doing stuff I really love.
- I love open source, currently doing stuff in Istio, an open source service mesh.

## Non-Tech Stuff

- I like swimming (specifically open-water), have done alcatraz a few times.
- People are awesome and I realize that. I love having discussions with people about all sorts of topics (tech, politics, funniest SNL skit ever).
- theLonelyIsland is the best band (yes I camel cased that).
